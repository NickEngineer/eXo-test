1. Create a war project using maven-war-plugin (war: war)
or use the ready war from target (buildshop.war).

2. Copy war to projects on the server
(tested on apache-tomcat-9.0.26).

3. Start the server

4. The system is ready to use.
Follow the link: http://localhost:8080/buildshop/

server (data/data.csv) or used existing ones.
